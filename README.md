## My Comments 
This article was written by the Verge on the new Apple Vision Pro Augmented Reality Headset. I found this article interesting because the Vision Pro appeares to be a leap forward in this technology. It has a very high price of $3,500 whereas competitors such as the Quest 3 start at $500. However, the Vision Pro is targeted at allowing people to enjoy the world around them while using the headset. The Quest 3 was mainly marketed towards gaming. The Vision Pro has made significant leaps in hand and eye tracking which I believe can be used in other scenarios outside of AR. For instance, this technology may be applied towards surgeries being done remotely with robots. Additionally, the Vision Pro can support simulated 4K displays which can help with things such as multitasking. This can cut down on spending costs or setting up a multiple monitor workstation.

## Henry Zhang's Comments

I like how the article considers tradeoffs that are not technical questions, but questions that consumers ask, such as "Is using the Vision Pro so good that Iâ€™m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on?."  This question makes me realise that even though the Vision pro is a technological product, it is ultimatly a consumer good that is purchaced by non-technical consumers. I also find it very appealing that the Vision Pro, like all other apple products, integrate so well into the Apple ecosystem, which is extremely convenient and user-friendly.

I agree with your comment's that the price is extremely high compared to it's competitors. However, your insight on how the Apple Vision Pro can actually cut spending costs by enabling multitasking without having to purchace and set up multiple monitors/workstations was actually very insightful and something I did not consider when assessing the cost of the headseat.
