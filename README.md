## My Comments 
This article was written by the Verge on the new Apple Vision Pro Augmented Reality Headset. I found this article interesting because the Vision Pro appeares to be a leap forward in this technology. It has a very high price of $3,500 whereas competitors such as the Quest 3 start at $500. However, the Vision Pro is targeted at allowing people to enjoy the world around them while using the headset. The Quest 3 was mainly marketed towards gaming. The Vision Pro has made significant leaps in hand and eye tracking which I believe can be used in other scenarios outside of AR. For instance, this technology may be applied towards surgeries being done remotely with robots. Additionally, the Vision Pro can support simulated 4K displays which can help with things such as multitasking. This can cut down on spending costs or setting up a multiple monitor workstation.
